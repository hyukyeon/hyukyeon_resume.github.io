          **Development of High-Efficiency and High-Performance Signal Processing for mmWave System**
          - *2017.07 ~ 2019.06*
          - In this project, we study the high efficiency and high performance algorithms targeting ***5G mmWave systems***. In the first year, we proposed ***a bit allocation optimization algorithm for low-resolution ADC considering power efficiency***. In the second year, ***null-space projection-based precoding for hybrid MU-MIMO*** was proposed. ***A low-latency, high-performance compressed sensing-based channel estimation scheme*** for the mmwave sparse channel environment has also been proposed.

          **Development of Modulation Method and Algorithm for Next Generation Wireless Communications**
          - *2014.01 ~ 2016.06*
          - In this project, a high-performance low-complexity transmission / reception algorithm suitable for hardware implementation in SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO systems targeting ***IEEE 802.11ac standard*** was developed. In the MU-MIMO environment, we have developed ***a detection algorithm that accurately removes interference from other STAs*** which outperforms the conventional interference-whitening method. In the next year, we have developed ***a hard decision and soft decision algorithm based on Lattice Reduction*** with fixed complexity for detecting low complexity of multiple streams. In addition, the early-termination formula is derived to allow low-power lattice reduction to be performed.
